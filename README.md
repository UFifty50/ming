# ming
It's just a nice music program i made for my girlfriends birthday :)

## building
### linux
Ming requires python 3.9 to build, as well as all the modules in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt),
So once you have installed python, make sure to install them with ``python3.9 -m pip install -r requirements.txt``

once that is done, all you should need to do is run `build.sh`

### windows
Similarly to above, Ming requires python 3.9 to build, including the modules in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt).
To install them run ``python -m pip install -r requirements.txt``

once thats done run `build.bat`
